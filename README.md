## Behavioural analysis

Youâ€™ll start by editing this README file to learn how to edit a file in Bitbucket.

1. Run the script [**Timelimit01_behavioral.m**](https://github.com/biancasama/timelimit/blob/master/Timelimit01_behavioral.m). You need to have [pre-processed files](http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/tutorial/preprocessing_erp/) in the form 'TimeLimit_v2_Resp_subj%02d_EEG_clean_concat_rej_interp' or 'TimeLimit_2_subj%02d_EEG_clean_concat_rej_interp'.
2. Run my internal function **BTmy_cleandatamore** that sets up indexes for getting only the good trials and sort them based on the condition.
3. If you need to control for a specific condition, run the mirror script **[Timelimit01_behavioral_control.m]**(https://github.com/biancasama/timelimit/blob/master/Timelimit01_behavioral_control.m)
